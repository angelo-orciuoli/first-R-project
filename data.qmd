## Data source

Our dataset: https://www.nber.org/research/data/vital-statistics-natality-birth-data 
This extensive dataset comprises 3,669,928 observations encompassing 225 distinct factors. This Natality Data, sourced from the National Vital Statistics System by the National Center for Health Statistics, offers comprehensive demographic and health information pertaining to births within a given calendar year. This microdata is meticulously compiled from details extracted from birth certificates filed across the statistics offices of each state and the District of Columbia, providing a robust foundation for in-depth analysis and insights into the dynamics of childbirth and associated health trends.

For our study, the dataset stands as a valuable resource for seeking insights into the intricate interplay of maternal education, racial backgrounds, and maternal age on diverse facets of childbirth, healthcare, and demographic trends in the United States. This dataset plays a pivotal role in elucidating disparities and serves as a cornerstone for enhancing healthcare and support systems for expectant mothers and newborns, ultimately contributing to the advancement of maternal and child well-being.

## About the data 
The variable in our dataset including: 
“mager”: Mother’s age of pregnancy “cig_before” (our variable): A variable we created that observes mothers who’ve smoked before pregnancy  (“cig_0”), but not during(0 values for cig_1,cig_2, and cig_3) “cig_during” (our variable): A variable we created that observes mothers who’ve smoked during pregnancy (positive values in cig_1, cig_2, cig_3, cig_0) “cig_none” (our variable): A variable we created that observes whether or not the mother smoked at all “rf_gdiab”: Gestational diabetes “previs”: Number of prenatal visits  “meduc”: Mother’s education in by level.  “bmi”: Mother’s BMI. For Column Transformations, we have transformed the cig_0 (daily number of cigarettes before pregnancy), cig_1 (daily number of cigarettes during 1st trimester), cig_2 (daily number of cigarettes during 2nd trimester), and cig_3 (daily number of cigarettes during 3rd trimester) variables, to create two new dummy variables: “cig_before”, “cig_during”, and “cig_none”. These dummy variables would show whether or not smoking only before, during, or none at all affect the weight of the infant.

## data cleaning
For each year, a sample of size sample_size (set to 20,000) is taken from the cleaned and structured dataset. After processing the individual yearly datasets, We combines them into one large dataset (birthdata). Finally, the combined database to Birth related statistical data and US yearly income-social economics.We also use Real Per Capita Personal Income for the United States (RPIPCUS) from Federal Reserve Economic Data.We find Birth related statistic data by web crawler the NVSS website to get yearly  Birth related statistic numbers from 2016-2022. The use of additional R packages such as "pROC" and "broom" can greatly enhance the analysis and interpretation of logistic regression models, providing more depth and clarity in the results.

The "pROC" package is a powerful tool in the R ecosystem designed specifically for analyzing and visualizing Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. ROC curves are essential for evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of probability predictions in binary classification models. They plot the true positive rate (sensitivity) against the false positive rate (1 - specificity) at various threshold settings, helping to determine the threshold that best separates the two classes. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) is a single scalar value derived from the ROC curve that summarizes the model's ability to discriminate between the positive and negative classes. An AUC value close to 1 indicates a model with excellent predictive accuracy, while an AUC close to 0.5 suggests no discriminatory power. The "pROC" package simplifies these tasks by providing functions to compute ROC curves, AUC scores, and to compare different ROC curves, thus providing a nuanced evaluation of model performance.

The "broom" package in R is designed to work in tandem with modeling functions like lm() and glm(). It takes the output of these models and converts them into tidy data frames. This is particularly useful because the standard output from modeling functions in R does not lend itself easily to downstream data manipulation and visualization tasks. By using "broom," analysts can quickly extract model coefficients, standard errors, p-values, and other important metrics from their models and use them in conjunction with packages like "ggplot2" for advanced visualizations. For instance, the tidied output from "broom" can be used to create coefficient plots which provide a visual interpretation of the influence each predictor has on the response variable, thus making the interpretation of model outputs more intuitive and insightful.

The caret package effectively abstracts much of the complexity involved in the model-building process, allowing analysts and data scientists to focus on interpreting results and making decisions based on the model's predictions. It's a valuable addition to the data analysis workflow, particularly for those aiming to produce robust, reproducible predictive models.


  * Describe and show code for how you combined multiple data files and any cleaning that was necessary for that.

library(dplyr)
birthdata <-read.csv("dataset/cleanedbirth.csv")
BirthStat <- read.csv("dataset/BirthStat.csv")
YI <- read.csv("dataset/Yearly income data.csv")
combirth <- birthdata |>
  left_join(YI, by = c("Year" = "Year"))
allbirth <- combirth |>
  left_join(BirthStat, by = c("Year" = "Year"))

In the data consolidation process for our analysis, we orchestrated the integration of multiple datasets to construct a singular, enriched dataset using R's dplyr package. The foundational dataset birthdata, which contains cleaned birth records, was merged with yearly income data (YI) based on the common 'Year' variable, ensuring a chronological alignment of data points. This initial merge formed combirth, a dataset that now encapsulates both birth records and associated income data for corresponding years.

Subsequently, we augmented combirth with the BirthStat dataset, which includes various birth statistics obtained from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS). The left_join function was employed once again on the 'Year' variable, creating allbirth, a comprehensive dataset that not only details birth records with socio-economic context provided by income data but also integrates broader birth statistics, enhancing the dataset's depth and potential for nuanced analysis. This meticulous merging process was imperative for subsequent analysis, as it consolidated relevant variables into a single frame of reference for robust statistical examination.
